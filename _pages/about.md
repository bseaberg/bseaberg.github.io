# Welcome

My name is Byron Seaberg. 

I'm currently studying at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the [MechE](https://meche.mit.edu/) department. I work in the [MIT Precision Motion Control Laboratory](https://pmc.mit.edu/about) under [Prof. David Trumper](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/trumper@mit.edu). My research involves the mechanical design and control of positioning systems for use in semiconductor photolithography tools.

Please check out some of the past [projects](https://bseaberg.github.io/posts/) I have included on this site. If you would like to contact me, don't hesitate to reach out through one of the means listed.
Thanks for stopping by!
